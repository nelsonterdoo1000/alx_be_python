# This is a  basic program that will carry out simple Arithmetic Operations using two numbers

#initalize the two numbers

number1 = 10
number2 =  5 

# Addition operations
addition_result = number1 + number2


# multiplication operation
multiplication_result = number1 * number2

#subtraction operation
subtraction_result = number1 - number2

print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication_result}")
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2}  is {addition_result}")
print(f"Difference of {number1} and {number2} is {subtraction_result}")
